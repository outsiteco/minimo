# Sunsets

Those of us crashing in Canggu are seriously spoiled with the sunset situation. Within a 30 minutes is the most famous spot on the island for sunset, [Tanah Lot Temple](http://www.bali-indonesia.com/magazine/tanah-lot.htm). Who ever decided to put this temple in the sea had sunsets on their mind or it was the happiest of coincidences. Entrace to this site will run you about 60k, so come with the case in hand well ahead of the sunset to get the best spot.

Echo is another picturesque place nearby our home in Canggu. At Echo you not only have the beautiful backdrop of the sunset but also the scene on the beach. Definitely a happening spot.

We highly recommend [La Brisa](http://labrisabali.com/) for those with an affinity to sunset gazing. Oh, and their Salmon is delicous!
