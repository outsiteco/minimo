A lot of people come to Canggu for a slightly more chill vibe than Seminyak or Kuta. Canggu, is more low key then those two spot, but it isn't a sleepy beach town either.

Canggu is full of people surfing, rice fields, wildly healthly cafes and more coworking spaces than your inner hustler can handle.

There is something for every here exept looking for a slighly more chill beach scene.
