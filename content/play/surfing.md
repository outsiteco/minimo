# Surfing

Canggu is a great place to explore your inner surfer. Get to the beach early in the morning before the sun is high in the sky. Rent a board from the beach or strap your own to a bike.

Rentals on the beach will run 50k for a couple hours and it's going to be 2k to park at most spots.

## The Surf Spots (from East to West)

### Berawa

Berawa is a long beach break just in front of Finns beach club. Finns is the Potato Head of Canggu. This is one of the less powerful breaks in the area, but it does offer plent of room for newby to intermediate to spread out.

As the sun sets the beach bungalos open up to cater to those coming out of the surf hoping to enjoy a cold coconut or Bintang.

### Old Mans

Old Mans is considered the easiest of the three with long, fast waves that barrel when big. Most surfers take rights on these, but you can also get a good left in the black volcanic sand beach.

The not so great part about surfing at Old Mans is that the waves are so nice and easy that everyone ends up here as some point. Expect a lot of party waves if you so up at prime time.

You might be lucky enough to get your own if you come before 7 am or after 6 pm, but don't count on much light during these hours. If you get annoyed with a lot of surfers around, then you'll want to avoid this spot.

### Echo Beach

This beach offers three breaks. You have reef breaks on the left and right, plus a beach break dead center.

If you have read the text above, then you know this is considered the more advanced break of the three. Here you'll find more intermediate surfers catching these more powerful waves.

For those down for the challenge this is a beautiful spot. Be sure to catch sunset at [La Brisa](http://labrisabali.com/) when you are done with your session.
