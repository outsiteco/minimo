# Yoga

Canggu might not be able to offer the same level of spiritual awakening as Ubud, but it isn't without it fair share of yoga studios.

For a more spiritual practice you can check out [Samadi]()https://www.samadibali.com/). A good time to check them out might actually be Sunday morning before their [market](https://www.samadibali.com/organic-sunday-market/). The Outsite crew often visit Samadi to grab a solid cup of coffee patiently brewed by a master.

If you are looking for more variey, then we I could suggest a couple different studios: [The Practice](https://www.thepracticebali.com/yoga/schedule/) and [The Canggu Studio](http://www.thecanggustudio.com/). The Practice specializes in all things yoga while the Studio offers other forms of practice such as pilates and weight lifting.

To more havens for the yoga curious are [Serenity](http://serenitybali.com/en/yoga/schedule/) and [Udara](http://www.udara-bali.com/). Serentiy has a strong lean toward caring for the environment. I believe they actually coordinate a beach clean up on Tuesday morning that I hope to participate in very soon. Udara is a lush resort with amazing space just outside of Canggu. Both of these places host acro yoga jams and Udara has a special all you can each buffet on Sunday.

You could literally spend all your days in these studios. There is that much going on in the yoga scene.
