# Social Networks

We have all heard of people coming to Bali to unplug and get in touch with themselves. While you can 100% do that in the serene beauty of Bali it isn't the best way to connect with the communities.

People use Facebook for that task.

Believe it or not Facebook has brought me in touch with chefs to train our staff, clinics to treat street animals with skin problems, beaches to clean up with friendly communitys, acro yoga jams and SO much more.

Here are a few of the communities you might want to check out if scoping out the social scene is on your agenda.
