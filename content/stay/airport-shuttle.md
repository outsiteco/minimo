# Transportation to the Villa

Getting from to airport, in Denpasar, to our villa in Canggu isnâ€™t as easy as hailing an Uber. In fact hailing an Uber is the last thing you want to do. Unfortunately, Uber is not cook with the locals here!

But donâ€™t worry, we have it all worked out ðŸ˜…

In the case of a transfer from the airport send **your name**, **flight number**, and **arrival time** to [bali@outsite.co](mailto:bali@outsite.co) and [robert@outsite.co](mailto:robert@outsite.co) so we can arrange to have a driver pick you up.

They'll be waving a big Outsite sign with you name on it just outside baggage claim.

Before you exit through the gift shop, be sure to pick up a hand full of Ruhpiah (~1 M) so you have a way to pay for food and other things you might want from the convenience store next door. Oh, and the ride itself. That shouldn't cost you more than $250k.
