Before you go holding us to rock solid standards I want you to recognize that this routine is subject to change and nothing is mandatory. If you find something worth adding to the routine, let me know so I can pop it on the calendar.

# The Weekly Ritual
* Monday to Friday [Canggu Early Morning Mastermind](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1948177585216059/)
* Tuesday // Mosiquite fumigation and lawn care from 2pm to 5pm
* Wednesday // Bounce House
* Friday // Acro yoga at Serenity
* Saturday  // Beach clean up with Trash Hero Canggu
* Sunday // Samadi farmers marker from 9am to 12pm and Acro at Utara

Hopefully this gives you a solid base to build off.
