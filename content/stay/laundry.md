# Laundry

Dirty clothes happen, especially here in Bali. So much for getting multiple uses out of your gym clothes. No way! We sweat far too much for that on this muggy island.

Not to worry. Our staff has it sorted. Drop your clothes with them at the front desk and they will take care of the rest.

The earlier you leave your clothed with them the more likely you are to get your items back with 24 hours.

Laundry usually isn't more than 50k, so have that handy when you are ready to pick up your pile on the following day. The staff will be looking for payment on the spot.
