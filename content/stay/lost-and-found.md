#Lost and Found

If you have lost or think something may have been taken tell the house manager as soon as possible. You can reach Robert on WhatsApp at +1 (901) 634-8275 or email him at robert@outsite.co.

If you lose a room key the staff can cut you a new one from 150k.

If you have reported items lost or stolen from your room we are not liabel.
